```markdown
# 🧑‍💻 Employee Directory App — Ajackus Frontend Assignment

## 1. 🚀 Setup and Run Instructions

This project is built using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

- No backend or server setup is needed.
- **To run the app:**  
  👉 Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser.

> 💡 Freemarker template (`employee-list.ftl`) is included to show how dynamic rendering would work.  
Mock employee data is handled using in-browser JavaScript and localStorage.

## 4. ✍️ Reflection

### 🧩 Challenges Faced
- Simulating backend behavior entirely in frontend using JavaScript and localStorage.
- Ensuring responsive layout looked clean across all screen sizes — especially with fixed footer + 2-column layout on mobile.
- Structuring logic modularly while avoiding frameworks or external libraries.

### 🌱 Improvements If Given More Time
- Add real backend with API and database integration.
- Improve mobile animations/transitions and polish UI further.
- Allow dynamic department/role values instead of hardcoded options.
- Use a JS framework (like React or Vue) for larger scalability and reusability.
- Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

✅ Built with ❤️ and a focus on clean, functional frontend engineering.
